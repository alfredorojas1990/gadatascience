    "# Project Design Writeup and Approval Template\n",
    "\n",
    "Follow this as a guide to completing the project design writeup. The questions for each section are merely there to suggest what the baseline should cover; be sure to use detail as it will make the project much easier to approach as the class moves on.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Project Problem and Hypothesis\n",
    "* What's the project about? What problem are you solving?\n",
    "\n",
    "This data set provides info to help predict behavior to retain customers. Analyzing all relevant customer data and develop focused customer retention programs.\n",
    "A telecommunications company is concerned about the number of customers leaving their landline business for cable competitors. They need to understand who is leaving. \n",
    "The main problem to solve is to find out who is leaving and why. \n",
    "\n",
    "The hypothesis defined is: Are the customers that signed for a month contract churning more than the ones with 1 or 2 year contracts?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Where does this seem to reside as a machine learning problem? Are you predicting some continuous number, or predicting a binary value?\n",
    "\n",
    "It seems to reside as a machine learning problem because we have a set of defined characteristics and variables from each consumer as inputs and only one binary final outcome that will be if the user churned or not. \n",
    "\n",
    "* What kind of impact do you think it could have?\n",
    "\n",
    "The impact is related entirely to revenue, the less users we churned the better the company will be and the more strategies that can be linked to prevent this situation to happen. \n",
    "\n",
    "* What do you think will have the most impact in predicting the value you are interested in solving for?\n",
    "\n",
    "I think that some variables such as type of contract, amount of money to pay and number of services signed up will be the main variables impacting the final result. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Datasets\n",
    "* Description of data set available, at the field level (see table)\n",
    "\n",
    "Variable | Description | Type of Variable\n",
    "---| ---| ---\n",
    "customerID | IDnumber | continous\n",
    "gender  | female, male | ccategorical\n",
    "SeniorCitizen | senior citizen=1 or not senior citizen=0 | categorical\n",
    "Partner | has a partner=Yes or has not a partner=No | categorical\n",
    "Dependents | has dependents=Yes or has not dependents=No | categorical\n",
    "tenure | number of months the customer has stayed with the company| continuous\n",
    "PhoneService | has a phone service=Yes or has not a phone service=No | categorical\n",
    "MultipleLines | has multiple lines=Yes or has not multiple lines=No, No Phone Service | categorical\n",
    "InternetService | Customer’s internet service provider (DSL, Fiber optic, No) | categorical\n",
    "OnlineSecurity | has online security=Yes or has not online security=No, No internet service | categorical\n",
    "OnlineBackup | customer has online backup or not (Yes, No, No internet service) | categorical\n",
    "DeviceProtection | customer has device protection or not (Yes, No, No internet service) | categorical\n",
    "TechSupport | customer has tech support or not (Yes, No, No internet service) | categorical\n",
    "streamingTV | customer has streaming TV or not (Yes, No, No internet service) | categorical\n",
    "streamingMovies | customer has streaming movies or not (Yes, No, No internet service) | categorical\n",
    "Contract | The contract term of the customer (Month-to-month, One year, Two year) | categorical\n",
    "PaperlessBilling | has paperless billing=Yes or has not paperless billing=No | categorical\n",
    "PaymentMethod | payment method (Electronic check, Mailed check, Bank transfer (automatic), Credit card (automatic))) | categorical\n",
    "MonthlyCharges | amount charged to the customer monthly | continuous\n",
    "TotalCharges | total amount charged to the customer | continuous\n",
    "Churn | churned=Yes not churned=No | categorical\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The raw data contains 7043 rows (customers) and 21 columns (features). The “Churn” column is our target.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Domain knowledge\n",
    "* What experience do you already have around this area?\n",
    "I've worked with this situations before in my previous job but in manual, not machine learning way. Obtaining, exploring and analyzing data related to influencers and creating buckets, segments, profiles and personas that will be related to each one of them and understanding which are the ones that are leaving and why. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Does it relate or help inform the project in any way?\n",
    "No, but it will help me in my professional growth\n",
    "\n",
    "* What other research efforts exist?\n",
    "This is a learning dataset so there are many other sources that can talk about this. In the place that I found it is from IBM watson and I was able to find a different solution using R \n",
    "\n",
    "https://www.ibm.com/communities/analytics/watson-analytics-blog/predictive-insights-in-the-telco-customer-churn-data-set/\n",
    "\n",
    "https://towardsdatascience.com/predict-customer-churn-with-r-9e62357d47b4\n",
    " \n",
    " In the watson one the final solution is a Decision Tree and in the R one they use a Decision Tree and a Random Forest \n",
    " \n",
    "### Project Concerns\n",
    "* What questions do you have about your project? What are you not sure you quite yet understand? (The more honest you are about this, the easier your instructors can help).\n",
    "* What are the assumptions and caveats to the problem?\n",
    "\n",
    "I think that data wise I have all the information required, but I am not sure yet if in the making of let say the finla outcome i have to create dummy variables of all my categories or in the case that I'm running the random forest or decision tree this will not be a problem at all. \n",
    "\n",
    "* What are the risks to the project?\n",
    "The risk will be to create misleading strategies that won't result in decreasing the churn at all\n",
    "Or having to many variables and creating multicollinearity without knowing\n",
    "\n",
    "### Outcomes\n",
    "* What do you expect the output to look like?\n",
    "\n",
    "I expect to have a tree in which I am able to understand which are the main resposnibles about the churn of customers. And understanding why is that a factor that is making them leave. Having the top nodes and the importance coefficient will be important to advance with this situation. In my top node I would say that the type of contract will be the first, followed by the type of service they are subscribed and the amount they are paying.\n",
    "\n",
    "* What does your target audience expect the output to look like?\n",
    "\n",
    "I imagine that my target audience is aligned with my expectations \n",
    "\n",
    "* What gain do you expect from your most important feature on its own?\n",
    "\n",
    "Being able to create segments, profiles or personas that can help me guide the outcome and take more defined actions around this. \n",
    "\n",
    "* How complicated does your model have to be?\n",
    "\n",
    "It does not have to be complicated at all, but granular maybe yes to undersatand the nuances of the correlation of all the features involved in the result of being churned.\n",
    "\n",
    "* How successful does your project have to be in order to be considered a \"success\"?\n",
    "\n",
    "Being able to predict which profiles are churning and understanding th reasons behind it\n",
    "\n",
    "* What will you do if the project is a bust (this happens! but it shouldn't here)?\n",
    "\n",
    "We will have to focus in different strategies to try to decrease the churn situation and these ones will require maybe surveys, interviews with clients and a more subjective approach\n",
