When predictor variables in the same regression model are correlated, they cannot independently predict the value of the dependent variable. In other words, they explain some of the same variance in the dependent variable, which in turn reduces their statistical significance.\""

    "\n",
    "So, how do you know if you need to be concerned about multicollinearity in your regression model? Here are some things to watch for:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A regression coefficient is not significant even though, theoretically, that variable should be highly correlated with Y.\n",
    "* When you add or delete an X variable, the regression coefficients change dramatically.\n",
    "* You see a negative regression coefficient when your response should increase along with X.\n",
    "* You see a positive regression coefficient when the response should decrease as X increases.\n",
    "* Your X variables have high pairwise correlations. \n",
    "\n",
    "The VIF measures how much the variance of an estimated regression coefficient increases if your predictors are correlated. More variation is bad news; we're looking for precise estimates. If the variance of the coefficients increases, our model isn't going to be as reliable. "
